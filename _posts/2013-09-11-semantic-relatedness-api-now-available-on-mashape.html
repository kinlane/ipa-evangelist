<p>The Amtera Semantic Relatedness API provides an easy-to-use service, which supports applications accessing a large-scale distributional knowledge base.  The API’s core operation is to calculate the semantic relatedness between pairs of text excerpts based on the likeness of their meaning or semantic content.   By incorporating semantic approximations and disambiguation functionalities, Amtera can differentiate between a movie star and a star cluster or galaxy.The service is optimized to support the high throughput needed for industry applications.  Currently the service is available in English and Portuguese.</p>
