<p>As demand for our Nutritionix API is starting to grow rapidly, we have been working on finding an API documentation engine to meet our needs for the long-term. I was not able to find any comprehensive list of existing API documentation solutions, so I am compiling what I have found so far.Please leave feedback on your own experience in the comments.We are still exploring each solution, but I will update this post as we learn more about each option.Swagger - A specification and complete framework implementation for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services.</p>
