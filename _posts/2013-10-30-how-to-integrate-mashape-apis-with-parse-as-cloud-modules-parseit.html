<p>Parse is a backend-as-a-service (BAAS) platform that lets you focus on building your applications without worrying about server and infrastructure maintenance and complexities. If you haven’t heard or tried Parse before, I encourage you to try their Quickstart here to get an idea of how the BAAS paradigm works.This post shows an example of a Mashape API integrated with Parse through Parse Modules. Parse Modules are libraries that Parse developers import into their app to use certain functionality offered by 3rd-party APIs. Once your API is turned into a Parse Module, it will be easier for developers to use it in their applications.</p>
