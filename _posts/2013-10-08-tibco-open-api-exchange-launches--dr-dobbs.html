<p>The TIBCO Open API Exchange is a self-service portal for developers to get started with the on-boarding process of providing business transparency related to the use of open APIs in their applications.This integrated solution for implementing an open API business strategy is designed to make it simple for enterprise developers to help expand their businesses into new revenue and marketing channels.NOTE: The developer portal also provides a fully integrated environment to create, test, document, and publish open APIs, with support for REST-based API styles, and seamless transformation of data and message formats, such as XML and JSON.Company CTO Matt Quinn says that, As companies open up new levels of access to internal data and business functionality through the use of open APIs, they require solutions that provide advanced security enforcement and threat protection, managing and securing access to their data across broad range of platforms and web-based mobile devices.Examples of policy domains managed by the product include authentication, throttling, content-based message routing, mediation, and message transformation.</p>
